## Overview

<p align="center>
Are you spending enough time every day on the things that are important to you?

TimeCraft is a lightweight MacOS app that lives on the menubar. You can configure different goals that you want to spend time on everyday, and track their time.

You start/stop the timers from the menubar before starting your activity. And at the end of the day, review if you met your goals. For me this serves as a constant reminder to take out some time for certain things that are important but are easy to overlook.
